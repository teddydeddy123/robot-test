# React + TypeScript + Vite

## npm install

## npm run dev

## This repo contains cypress testing via ##npm run cypress:run##

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

After careful examination of the brief I received I have strong reasons to believe that the examples given for each function and the test at the end of the document use different methodologies. As a consequence the result of the tests is different than the one indicated in the pdf. For further details please consult comments in each cypress test.

GENERAL UI/UX DETAILS:

On the left, there is a list of instructions with description
User must first either place a wall or a robot
Before there is a robot on the board the other functions such as Left, Move etc. will not become accessible from the select dropdown.
In order to execute each action and the values inside the inputs the user must click on the Generate button. This will trigger the corresponding function.
For those actions which per the brief's instructions are to be ignored the UI displays an error message showing there is something wrong and general description of the reason.
